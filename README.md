The app works by scanning QR codes and barcodes, and when the user scans a QR code or barcode, the authenticity of the product can be verified. In addition, the app provides location of the user and the device information, including device model, device brand, and Android version for Android, and relevant iOS information, are displayed. The app is also equipped with an in-app WebView widget, enabling various platforms like Audiomack,Boomplay, and other platforms to be accessed within the app when qrcodes or barcodes with url that redirects to mentioned platforms are scanned thus enabling the users to scan and access the platform within the app without redirecting to the browser. The technologies used are Dart Language and the Flutter Framework, with several libraries provided by Flutter.
